# ETL Data Engineering Pipeline for Formula 1 Data using Azure Platform

### Introduction
Formula 1 is a popular motorsport that generates a vast amount of data. This data can be used to gain insights into the performance of drivers, teams, and cars. With the advent of cloud computing and big data technologies, it has become easier to process and analyze this data to gain valuable insights. The objective of this project is to build an ETL Data Engineering Pipeline for Formula 1 Data using Azure Platform by ingesting raw data from external sources to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) using Azure Data Factory, processing and transforming the data using Azure Databricks and creating visualizations and reports using Power BI.
